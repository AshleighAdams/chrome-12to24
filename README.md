	2. Navigate to 'chrome://extensions'
	3. Click/enable 'Developer mode' in the top right hand corner
	4. Click 'Load unpacked extension...' navigate and click on this folder.
	5. Rock!


The boilerplate loads a barebones index.html which loads libs.js, app.js. A style.css, bootstrap and font-awesome.

The libraries included are JQuery, Backbone, Underscore and Backbone.localStorage.
